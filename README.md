QuickQuestionLocal
==================


Hi, this is code for a website that allows a user to embed questions into a Facebook post or email and receive answers
via clicked hyperlinks.

To see it in prod, to http://www.quickquestion.me. You need a facebook account to sign in.

The code here is still being modified. Tests are located in MultipleChoice/tests.py.

This code relies on the open source django_facebook library for FB connectivity.

This was written by Moshe Adesnik as a demo of his django/general coding skills.
